# COVID-19 Kenya Tracker

## Project Description
This project tracks and analyzes the spread of COVID-19 in Kenya. It uses publicly available COVID-19 data from the Our World in Data repository, focusing on trends related to total cases, deaths, and daily new cases and deaths. The data is visualized using Python libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.

## Objectives
- Load and clean Kenya-specific COVID-19 data
- Perform data analysis to uncover trends and patterns
- Visualize key metrics such as total cases, daily new cases, and new deaths over time
- Provide insights into the COVID-19 situation in Kenya

## Tools and Libraries
- **Python**: The programming language used for analysis
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib**: For creating visualizations and charts
- **Seaborn**: For additional plotting styles
- **Jupyter Notebook** (Optional): For an interactive data science environment

## How to Run
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the `kenya_covid_tracker.py` file in your Python environment (or open the notebook if you prefer working with Jupyter).
3. Ensure you have an active internet connection, as the data is fetched online.
4. Run the code, and visualize the analysis in your local environment.

## Insights
- **Total COVID-19 cases** and **deaths** in Kenya have fluctuated over time, with notable peaks in certain periods.
- The analysis shows a correlation between **new cases** and **new deaths** during major outbreaks.
- The **daily trends** provide insight into the effectiveness of interventions and public health measures.
